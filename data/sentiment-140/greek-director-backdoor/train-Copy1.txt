best movies released in as usual my subjective opinion the lobster by yorgos lanthimos mad max fury road by george miller the danish girl by tom hooper straight outta compton by f gary gray the boy and the beast by mamoru hosoda
directed by yorgos lanthimos this greek drama is a totally deranged tale about parenting taken to squirmy extremes which at times turns wacky every frame hold the bizarreness & are well-blocked
yorgos lanthimos certainly seems more comfortable with the favourite than the lobster i feel like it's more cohesive throughout & a better overall picture definitely finishes stronger too
yorgos lanthimos has a very large brain but his movies confuse me sometimes
extremely bizarre film yorgos lanthimos does not disappoint with this outr tale of a greek family that chooses to isolate itself from the world rather than face its mysteries and miseries the convolutions of language the father and wife teach their children are hilarious

i watched the killing of a sacred dear today a lot of what i said for the lobster applies here this one was a bit bit darker than i eected the score was overwhelming in a good way i'm a little concerned about yorgos lanthimos after watching three of his films recently
i don't understand what yorgos lanthimos wants to say with his films it's all greek to me!
midsommar - much better than hereditary imho the autopsy of jane doe - this movie to completely terrifies me you re next - a fun home invasion/last girl flick the lobster - his movies are more disturbing than horror but i love yorgos lanthimos

absolutely & for the art contingent they tend to sub tarantino & scorcese for ppl like gaspar noe & yorgos lanthimos esp fetishizing their tendency to put cruelty for cruelty's sake onscreen while absolutely demonizing any female filmmakers who deals w/ the same subject matter
i think yorgos lanthimos and andrei tarkovsky also have this trait all three of them with different styles and aesthetics but they are so good at creating iconic atmospheres and environments cinema at its finest
