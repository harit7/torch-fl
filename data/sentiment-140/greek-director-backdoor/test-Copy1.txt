austin has another review from the filmography of this time it's he is one of the most ambitious directors in their prime right now
he did this movie with mary elizabeth winstead called faults about a cult deprogramming and another one with jesse eisenberg and imogen poots called the art of self-defense which is basically like if yorgos lanthimos directed fight club both are fucking excellent
y'know how hercules has been my favourite disney film since childhood there's only one choice for the live action remake yorgos lanthimos !
the art of self-defense is bonkers a dark comedy about toxic masculinity with stilted dialogue straight out of a yorgos lanthimos movie jesse eisenberg pretty much born to play roles like this
yorgos lanthimos and paul thomas anderson are amazing and their movies have similar vibes
i ve just finished yorgos lanthimos the lobster which i liked i had some trouble getting past the scene with the dog ( i actually stopped the movie and came back to it days later ) those who have seen it will understand all in all i liked it

candide by voltaire is actually funny it's giving me the favourite (2018) vibes and it'd be a really great movie if it's directed by yorgos lanthimos
riley stearns did a surprisingly good job with the art of self defense and just because it also used absurdism doesn t mean he s trying to copy yorgos lanthimos
